- JavaFX webview is broken on specific versions of Java (at least on OS X).
    - Make sure to test with the version the client uses

- Unsure if this properly supports XBL multi-user authentication
    - I believe the client allows you to choose your user?
    - I don't know if it's possible to have multiple on a single account.

- Token refreshes need to be implemented.
    - The "OAuth20Token" has a "refresh_token" supplied.
    - This can be used to send a "OAuth20TokenRequestByRefresh" payload to retrieve a new token
        - From there I'm assuming we can retrieve an XBL token again through the same process
        - Tokens expire in 1 day, so we need to do this often.

- Token sign out needs to be implemented
    - Not possible to currently invalidate a token

- AuthWebView is a singleton
    - It doesn't support authing multiple times in one process properly
        - This is because I do not know how the current client is using JavaFX
    - Needs to be fixed
